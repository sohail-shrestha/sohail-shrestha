ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with extensive experience delivering high-impact products across web and AI-driven platforms. I specialize in building scalable systems from the ground up, optimizing performance, and accelerating development through smart architecture and tooling.

ðŸ”§ What I Do Best:

Design and implement full-stack applications using TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, Python, and FastAPI

Architect microservices and scalable infrastructure with Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud-native tools

Integrate AI into product workflows, leveraging tools like the OpenAI SDK to reduce feature delivery time from 7 days to 1 day

Optimize backend systems by implementing caching, monitoring, and analyticsâ€”reducing API response times and improving system reliability

Establish technical foundationsâ€”defining frameworks, libraries, and code structure adopted across multiple teams and projects

Deliver MVPs quickly and efficiently, often with small teams under tight timelines

âš¡ I'm a quick and adaptive learner who thrives in fast-paced environments, and I'm passionate about solving real-world problems through clean, efficient code.
