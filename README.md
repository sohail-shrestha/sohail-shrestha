About Me

Hi there. Hope you're doing well.

I'm Sohail. I have 3 years of professional experiance in building Native Android Apps, and since I've joined Fusemachines on July 2021, I have had the opportunity to add Flutter, Nest.js, Node.js and React Native to my Tech Stack. 

I think adopting a tech stack for a project is better than adopting a project for a tech stack. What do you think?
